    "In order to have an overall view of how data is correlated, we select a range of k for knn and number of clusters, and then plot the graph with their corresponding accuracy to see if there is a significant trend or determine the best parameter value that can improve accuracy. We also select the features (both original and new generated) with highest score of mutual information, which data points are more closely linked together to improve accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a little improvement for feature selection and generation interaction pair, because we pick the features that have the highest mutual information., for knn with interaction pair, the accuracy hits the upper limit accuracy at k = 2(0.71287), this implies that the data point are clustered very closely so all the data are included when k = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "For clustering label, it is possible to improve the accuracy at some number of k, however the accuracy will converge at a certain amount of k. The accuracy peaked at around k = 22, and then converges to local optimum when k >= 30 (around 0.7), because there are only a certain amount of clusters and data points, there is a point where adding new cluster centre would not change anything.\n",
